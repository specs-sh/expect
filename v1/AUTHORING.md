## Expectations vs Assertions

The two most common test assertion styles in programming languages are:

> #### `assert`
>
> ```sh
> assert_equal "ACTUAL", "EXPECTED"
> ```

> #### `expect`
>
> ```sh
> expect "ACTUAL" equals "EXPECTED"
> ```

There are pros and cons to each, but at the end of the day it comes down to user preference.

`assert`

- Pros:
  - Classic 🥂
  - Easy to implement additional `assert_*` functions
- Cons:
  - Easy to forget which argument is `actual` and which is `expected`
  - Requires many `assert_*` functions
    > in BASH, these "pollute" the global namespace

`expect`

- Pros:
  - Reads closer to normal language, e.g. _expect '\$result' to equal 'foo'_
  - Only requires one top-level `expect` function
    > in BASH, this means not "polluting" the global namespace with extra functions
- Cons:
  - Slightly more complicated to implement additional `expect` matchers
    > ... as you'll see below! You'll fully implement a matcher 🍻

---

## Matcher functions

Let's implement the following **`toEq`** "matcher function"

```sh
expect "$answer" toEq 42
```

First, try running the above code _without_ implementing the function:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # expect.matcher.toEq: command not found
  ```

You'll see an error: **`expect.matcher.toEq: command not found`**

By default, `expect` expects a function to exist named `expect.matcher.[MATCHER_NAME]`

The name of the matcher in this case is: `toEq`.

## Write a matcher function

Next, add that function: **`expect.matcher.toEq()`**

To start with, just print out one thing:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    }
    ```

    > You can define the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!

Now, try running the code again:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  ```

Wonderful! This time the command did not fail and the `toEq` function was called.

As you can see, the `toEq` function received one positional argument: `42`

This is considered the **"expected result"**.

- > #### Optional
  >
  > Try passing additional arguments to `toEq`
  >
  > ```sh
  > $ expect "$answer" toEq 42 another argument "hello, world!"
  > # toEq called with 4 arguments: 42 another argument hello, world!
  > ```

But what about the `$answer` variable which is the **"actual result"**?

Instead of being provided as a positional argument, the "actual result" is available as a pre-defined variable.

## Get the actual result

Next, update the **`expect.matcher.toEq()`** function to print two things:

1.  Information about the arguments being passed to the function
2.  All of the currently defined variables which start with `EXPECT_`

    ```sh
    expect.matcher.toEq() {
      echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
      declare -p | grep EXPECT_
    }
    ```

    > You can redefine the above function right in your BASH shell, just copy/paste it in!  
    > It will replace the previous function definition.

Now, try running the code again. This time, set a value for `$answer`:

- ```sh
  $ source "expect.sh"

  $ answer="This is the actual result"

  $ expect "$answer" toEq 42
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: 42
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"
  ```

  > A summary of all `EXPECT_` variables is [found below](#foo) under [Supported `EXPECT` variables](#foo)

As you can see, there a number of `EXPECT_` variables available to the function.

The **"actual result"** is available in a variable named **`EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT`**:

- ```sh
  declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="This is the actual result"
  ```

## Compare actual and expected results

The `toEq` matcher function now has access to both the **"expected result"** and **"actual result"**.

Update the function to compare the expected and actual retults:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"                  # e.g. 42
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT" # e.g. "This is the actual result"

    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      echo "They match! This matcher should pass."
    else
      echo "Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail."
    fi
  }
  ```

Now, run the function again providing a variety of expected and actual values:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42
  # They match! This matcher should pass.

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42-42
  # Oh noes! They are not the same! This matcher should fail.
  ```

## Write failure messages

It would be more useful if the matcher provided more info about failures when they occur.

Update the function to print out the **"actual result"** and the **"expected result"** when it fails:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      echo "They match! I guess we don't need to print anything when it passes..."
    else
      echo "Expected values to equal"
      echo "Actual: $actualResult"
      echo "Expected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  }
  ```

Now, run the function again providing a variety of expected and actual values:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42
  # They match! I guess we don't need to print anything when it passes..

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42-42
  ```

That's more useful!

## Negating with 'not'

What about handling when `not` is provided?

```sh
$ expect "$answer" not toEq 42
```

Right now, the `expect.matcher.toEq()` function does not support `not`.

To see how to support using `not`, print out the `EXPECT` variables again:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    declare -p | grep EXPECT_
  }
  ```
- ```sh
  $ expect "Hello" toEq "World"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: World
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"

  $ expect "Hello" not toEq "World"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: World
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT="true"
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.0"
  ```

When the `not` keyword comes before the name of the matcher `EXPECT_NOT` is set to `"true"`.

Update the function to support when `not` is used:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      #
      # If they are equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        echo "Expected values not to equal"
        echo "Actual: $actualResult"
        echo "Not Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      #
      # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        echo "Expected values to equal"
        echo "Actual: $actualResult"
        echo "Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    fi
  }
  ```

Now run the function with and without the `not` keyword:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42-42-42

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42
  # Expected values not to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42
  ```

Wonderful! Looking great!

However, right now, a test would not fail because the function does not `return 1` or `exit 1`.

## Exit on failure

There are two common ways to "fail" an assertion or expectation in BASH test frameworks:

1.  `return 1` _(or any non-zero code)_
2.  `exit 1` _(or any non-zero code)_

Test frameworks that fail whenever a command `return 1` usually do this via `set -e`.

There are pros and cons to each approach.

`expect` can be used in either type of framework by using `expect.fail()`.

Here is the source code for the `expect.fail()` function from [`expect.sh`](https://github.com/bx-sh/expect.sh/blob/master/expect.sh):

- ```sh
  EXPECT_FAIL="exit 1"

  expect.fail() {
    echo -e "$*" >&2
    $EXPECT_FAIL
  }
  ```

By default, `expect` will `exit 1` whenever the `expect.fail()` function is called.

> Note: if you test this in your BASH shell, your shell will close and exit!

If you want to use `expect` in a framework like `Bats` which uses `set -e`:

- ```sh
  # Set the value of EXPECT_FAIL anywhere in your code before you use 'expect'
  EXPECT_FAIL="return 1"
  ```

Now, update the **`expect.matcher.toEq()`** function to call `expect.fail` on failure:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      #
      # If they are equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        expect.fail "Expected values not to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nNot Expected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      #
      # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
      if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
      then
        expect.fail "Expected values to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nExpected: $expectedResult"
      fi
    fi
  }
  ```

In your shell, set `EXPECT_FAIL="return 1"` and then try the function:

- ```sh
  $ expect 42 toEq 42

  $ echo $?
  # 0

  $ expect 42 toEq 42-42-42
  # Expected values to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42-42-42

  $ echo $?
  # 1

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42-42-42

  $ echo $?
  # 0

  $ expect 42 not toEq 42
  # Expected values not to equal
  # Actual: 42
  # Expected: 42

  $ echo $?
  # 1
  ```

**Reminder:** your function will `return` the exit status of the last command or function executed.

- If you plan to run any commands after you call `expect.fail()`, it is best practice to end your matcher with `return 0`
- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    local expectedResult="$1"
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

    if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
    then
      # Expect values NOT to be equal.
      # <...>
    else
      # Expect values to be equal.
      # <...>
    fi

    return 0
  }
  ```

## Block values

One limitation of using `expect "some value" toEq "another value"` is:

- The **"actual result"** can only be _ony value_, e.g. "some value"

But what if the value you are testing against is multiple values?

- e.g. You want to `expect "$@" toEq something"` (in BASH `"$@"` expands to multiple values)
- e.g. You want a command and arguments which your matcher will execute

If you want your matcher to take a command and arguments, you could try:

- `expect "command arg1 arg2" toRunSuccessfully`

But this runs into problems if you need to quote argument values:

- `expect "command 'Hello World' 'Value with spaces'" toRunSuccessfully`

To solve this problem, `expect` provides **blocks**:

- `expect { a list of things } toMeetMyExpectations`

By default, you can wrap your block in one, two, or three curly braces or brackets:

- `expect { a list of things } toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect {{ a list of things }} toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect {{{ a list of things }}} toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [ a list of things ] toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [[ a list of things ]] toMeetMyExpectations`
- `expect [[[ a list of things ]]] toMeetMyExpectations`

This provides flexibility, e.g. if you want `{` or `{{` or `{{{` etc to behave differently.

> ### Example
> 
> Provided matchers behave differently when using one -vs- two braces or brackets
> 
> When `{` or `[` is used, the block is executed to get the actual result
> 
> When `{{` or `[[` is used, the block is executed _in a subshell_ to get the actual result

### `EXPECT_BLOCK`

To see how to support blocks, print out the `EXPECT` variables again:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    echo "toEq called with $# arguments: $*"
    declare -p | grep EXPECT_
  }
  ```
- ```sh
  $ expect "Hello" toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT="Hello"
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=()
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"

  $ expect { "Hello" } toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT=""
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=([0]="Hello")
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE="{"
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"

  $ expect [[ "Hello" there, "how are" you? ]] toEq "something"
  # toEq called with 1 arguments: something
  # declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT=""
  # declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=([0]="Hello" [1]="there," [2]="how are" [3]="you?")
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n"
  # declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE="[["
  # declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toEq"
  # declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
  # declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.2.2"
  ```

As you can see, the content of the block is available in the `EXPECT_BLOCK` BASH array.

The symbol used for the block is available as `EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE`, e.g. `{` or `[[`.

If your matcher does not require the block syntax, fail your matcher when a block is provided:

- ```sh
  expect.matcher.toEq() {
    # If the block length is greater than one, fail the matcher with a message
    if [ "${#EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" -gt 0 ]
    then
      expect.fail "toEq does not support block syntax"
    fi
    # ...
  }
  ```

If you want to support executing commands, like the provided matchers, follow the next section.

## Support block syntax

This demonstrates an example implementation for executing block commands in matchers, e.g.

- ```sh
  expect { ls } toEq "file1\nfile2"
  ```

The `expect.matcher.toEq()` function will support three types of syntax:

- `expect "simple value" toEq "something"`
- `expect { command args } toEq "something"` - run command and verify its output
- `expect {{ command args }} toEq "something"` - run command in subshell and verify its output

For the block syntax, we will combine the command's `STDOUT` and `STDERR` and compare against that.

**Reminder:** functions will have access to all of the variables your matcher defines, including `local` variables!

- When we run `command args`, if it is a function, it will have access to ALL variables
- Because of this, we will prefix all of our variables with `___expect___toEq_`
- If we use a variable like `command`, it could cause variable naming collisions with the function's variables

### The Code (unabridged)

> _This shows an extended example, see `expect.execute_block` helper below for simpler version_

```sh
##
# expect.matcher.toEq: with block support
#
# see the matchers that come with expect.sh for similar examples
##
expect.matcher.toEq() {
  # By default, use the "actual result" provided by this syntax: expect "actual result" toEq "something"
  local ___expect___toEq_ActualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"

  # If a block was provided, use it to get the "actual value" as: STDOUT + STDERR
  if [ "${#EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" -gt 0 ]
  then
    local ___expect___toEq_RunInSubshell=""

    # If {  then do not run in subshell
    [ "$EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE" = "{" ] && ___expect___toEq_RunInSubshell="false"

    # If {{ then run in subshell
    [ "$EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE" = "{{" ] && ___expect___toEq_RunInSubshell="true"

    # If some other block type, give an error
    [ "$EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE" != "{" ] && [ "$EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE" != "{{" ] && { expect.fail "toEq only supports { or {{ blocks"; return 1; }

    # Do you want to fail the matcher if the command fails?
    # Or ignore a failure to allow the following example?
    # > expect { i fail } toEq "STDERR should equal this"
    # It is up to you. I will store the $? exit code but not use it.
    local ___expect___toEq_ReturnOrExitCode

    if [ "$___expect___toEq_RunInSubshell" = "true" ]
    then
      # Run the command in a $( subshell ) piping STDERR to STDOUT so they will be combined

      # Gotcha: this will NOT WORK if you try `local output="$( subshell )"`, the $? will not be correct.
      #         if you want to get the $? of the command, you need to define the local on a previous line.
      #
      ___expect___toEq_ActualResult="$( "${EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" 2>&1 )"

      # Get the exit code or return code of the command or function that was run
      ___expect___toEq_ReturnOrExitCode=$?
    else
      # Run the command regularly, not in a subshell, piping STDERR to STDOUT so they will be combined

      # To support getting the output of a command run locally (no subshell), store output in file
      local ___expect___toEq_outputTempFile="$( mktemp )"

      "${EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" 2>&1 >"$___expect___toEq_outputTempFile"

      # Get the exit code or return code of the command or function that was run
      ___expect___toEq_ReturnOrExitCode=$?

      # Populate the result variable by cat'ing the temporary file (which will add an extra newline)
      ___expect___toEq_ActualResult="$( cat "$___expect___toEq_outputTempFile" )"

      # Remove the extra newline
      ___expect___toEq_ActualResult="${___expect___toEq_ActualResult/%"\n"}"

      # Cleanup the tempfile
      rm -rf "$___expect___toEq_outputTempFile"
    fi
  fi

  # Now $___expect___toEq_ActualResult has been set from EITHER the block or regular `expect "simple" toEq "something"`
  #
  # The regular matcher code can go below! And because the command has already run, no reason to prefix variables
  #
  # Copy/pasted from the existing toEq function used in the previous examples
  local expectedResult="$1"
  local actualResult="$___expect___toEq_ActualResult"

  if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
  then
    # Expect values NOT to be equal.
    #
    # If they are equal, show a failure message.
    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      expect.fail "Expected values not to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nNot Expected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  else
    # Expect values to be equal.
    #
    # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
    if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      expect.fail "Expected values to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nExpected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  fi
}
```

**Reminder:** before trying this in your local shell, set `EXPECT_FAIL="return 1"`

Give it a shot!

To verify that `{ ... }` runs locally and `{{ ... }}` runs in a subshell, try changing a variable:

```sh
myFunction() {
  # change some variable in the command you run
  # will use this as an example, it will set x to the first argument provided
  x="$1"
  echo "Set x to $1"
}

x="hello"

echo "$x"
# hello

# This expectation will pass, but it runs in a subshell so it can't change variable values
expect {{ myFunction "this won't work" }} toEq "Set x to this won't work"

echo "$x"
# hello

# This expectation will pass and it runs locally so it can change variable values
expect { myFunction "haha I changed it" } toEq "Set x to haha I changed it"

echo "$x"
# haha I changed it
```

## `expect.execute_block`

Because executing the command inside a block is a common usage of blocks, `expect` provides a helper method for executing the code: `expect.execute_block`

- Runs the command in the `EXPECT_BLOCK`
- Sets `EXPECT_EXITCODE`, `EXPECT_STDOUT`, and `EXPECT_STDERR`

### The Code (using `expect.execute_block`)

```sh
##
# expect.matcher.toEq: with block support
#
# using `expect.execute_block` built-in helper function
##
expect.matcher.toEq() {
  if [ "${#EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}" -gt 0 ]
  then
    expect.execute_block
    local actualResult="${EXPECT_STDOUT}${EXPECT_STDERR}"
    # You can check EXPECT_EXITCODE to see if the command succeeded
  else
    local actualResult="$EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT"
  fi

  # Now $actualResult has been set from EITHER the block or regular `expect "simple" toEq "something"`
  local expectedResult="$1"
  local actualResult="$actualResult"

  if [ "$EXPECT_NOT" = "true" ]
  then
    # Expect values NOT to be equal.
    #
    # If they are equal, show a failure message.
    if [ "$actualResult" = "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      expect.fail "Expected values not to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nNot Expected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  else
    # Expect values to be equal.
    #
    # If they are not equal, show a failure message.
    if [ "$actualResult" != "$expectedResult" ]
    then
      expect.fail "Expected values to equal\nActual: $actualResult\nExpected: $expectedResult"
    fi
  fi
}
```

## Customize block styles

The default supported block types are 1-3 curly braces or brackets:

 - `{ ... }` `{{ ... }}` `{{{ ... }}}`
 - `[ ... ]` `[[ ... ]]` `[[[ ... ]]]`

You can change these by overriding or extending the `EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS` variable.

The `EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS` variable contains pairs of open/close strings delimited by `\n` newlines.

To also support wrapping blocks with `OPEN` and `CLOSE`:

```sh
source "expect.sh"

EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="${EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS}\nOPEN\nCLOSE"
```

You can test this in your shell:

```sh
expect.matcher.toTest() {
  echo "Hi from 'toTest' here is the $EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE block:"
  echo "${EXPECT_BLOCK[@]}"
  declare -p | grep EXPECT_
}

expect OPEN Cool I could use this syntax CLOSE toTest
# Hi from 'toTest' here is the OPEN block:
# Cool I could use this syntax
# declare -- EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT=""
# declare -a EXPECT_BLOCK=([0]="Cool" [1]="I" [2]="could" [3]="use" [4]="this" [5]="syntax")
# declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_CLOSE="CLOSE"
# declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_OPEN="OPEN"
# declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS="{\\n}\\n{{\\n}}\\n{{{\\n}}}\\n[\\n]\\n[[\\n]]\\n[[[\\n]]]\\n\\nOPEN\\nCLOSE"
# declare -- EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE="OPEN"
# declare -- EXPECT_FAIL="return 1"
# declare -- EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME="toTest"
# declare -- EXPECT_NOT=""
# declare -- EXPECT_VERSION="0.5.0"x
```

When a block is provided, matchers have access to these extra 2 variables:
 - `EXPECT_BLOCK_OPEN`
 - `EXPECT_BLOCK_CLOSE`

> In BASH you cannot/should not try to use any of these:
> 
> - `< ... >`
> - `( ... )`
> - `` ` ... ` ``
> - `' ... '`
> - `" ... "`

## Customize function names

By default, `expect` calls matcher functions in this format: `expect.matcher.[MATCHER_NAME]`

You can completely customize how `expect` finds functions by implementing your own matcher function.

To customize matcher invocation, define a function and set `EXPECT_MATCHER_FUNCTION=yourFunctionName`

```sh
EXPECT_MATCHER_FUNCTION=myExpectMatcherLookup

myExpectMatcherLookup() {
  echo "I should invoke a function which implements matcher: $EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME"
}

expect { hello world } toExecute OK
# I should invoke a function which implements matcher: toExecute
```

This adds complete flexibility, you could do anything.

You could use this to implement: `expect { ... } to be equalTo "something"`

Or you could invoke different functions based on whether a block was passed or a simple value.

You can do matcher lookup however best works for you.

## Supported `EXPECT` variables

| Variable Name              | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EXPECT_VERSION             | Returns version of `expect`                                                 |
| EXPECT_MATCHER_NAME        | Name of matcher invoked, e.g. `toEq`                                        |
| EXPECT_NOT                 | Set to `"true"` when `not` precedes matcher                                 |
| EXPECT_ACTUAL_RESULT       | Contains actual result (_blank value if a block was provided_)              |
| EXPECT_BLOCK               | BASH Array containing block (_empty array if no block provided_)            |
| EXPECT_BLOCK_TYPE          | Opening block character used, e.g. `{` (_blank value is no block provided_) |
| EXPECT_BLOCK_PAIRS         | Newline `\n`-delimited text pairs for detecting block open and close        |
| EXPECT_MATCHER_FUNCTION    | If provided, `expect` will invoke this instead of `expect.matcher.[name]`   |
